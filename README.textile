This is the agile deploy project. I guess it's quite diffuse name reflects the fact that 
it's not supposed to be some sort of big framework etc. but a utility.

What to do with it?

* *Bootstrap a simple webproject easily*. You could use Maven archetypes for this, but this 
project also includes an embedded Jetty server and a packagin scheme for this. This means 
you can have a project up and running, as well as an Servlet container to run it in in no 
time.

* *Use the deployer to easily deploy new versions of the application from the Maven 
repository*. This can be a version of the webapp created from the template, or some sort of 
batch program. Right now it works with ZIP files that create one complete package to be run 
from the command line.
