This is the agile deploy project. I guess it's quite diffuse name reflects the fact that 
it's not supposed to be some sort of big framework etc. but a utility.

What to do with it? *Use the deployer to easily deploy new versions of the application from the Maven 
repository*. This can be a version of the webapp created from the template, or some sort of 
batch program. Right now it works with ZIP files that create one complete package to be run 
from the command line.
