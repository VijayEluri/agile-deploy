This is my preferred setup when it comes to creating
Java applications. It handles several issues.

This is an early version and used for preparing for
my JavaZone 2009 talk on Agile Deployment.


= DONE =
* Packaging the application with all dependencies into
** A war
** A zip with all required JARs and WARs

= TODO =
* Installing the application by
** Downloading ZIP from Maven Repository
** Unpacking
** Installing settings
** Replacing Symlinks
* Upgrading the database

Some of these parts should probably be in something
like Scala or JRuby, but I'll have to take the time
to learn that later. :)
